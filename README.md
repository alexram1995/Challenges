#Challenges
## Here are the logic challenges, based on 
1. Code a program (in python) that displays the numbers from 1 to 100 on the
screen, substituting the multiples of 3 for the word "fizz", the multiples of 5 for
"buzz" and the multiples of both, that is, the multiples of 3 and 5, by the word
"fizz buzz".
Plus: Implement a test to the task performed (Preferably with UnitTest or pytest).
2. In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence or serie is the following infinite sequence
of natural numbers: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597 ...
where f (0) = 0, f (1) = 1 and f (n) = f (n-1) + f (n-2).
Code a program (in python) that solves for any number in the Fibonacci series.
Plus: Implement a test to the task performed (Preferably with UnitTest or Pytest).
3. Given an input text, Code a program (in python) that displays the number of
repetitions of each word.
Sample text: "Hi how are things? How are you? Are you a developer? I am also a
developer"
Plus: Implement a test to the task performed (Preferably with UnitTest or Pytest).

### To run it
1. You can just use `python logic_challenges.py and wait for the output`
2. Also you can run the tests by going to the `Tests` folder and use `pytest`
